# React - welcome back
## Description
This is a simple web page that I built with the aim of learing and testing React state.
## What I learned
- DECLARATIVE vs IMPERATIVE programming
- what is JSX
- why do we use className in JSX syntax
- why do we need to return always one element in JSX, that wraps children element (and why a JSX file cannot return two sibling elements)
- what is a React component
- what is create-react-app and why it is useful to start a project with it
- how to organiza components in React
- what is state in React
- how do we manage state in a component
